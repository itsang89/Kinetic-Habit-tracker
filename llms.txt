# Kinetic - Habit & Mood Tracker

> A minimalist habit and mood tracker built with Next.js 15 and Tailwind CSS 4.

## Core Structure
- [src/app/]: Application pages (Dashboard, Trends, Login).
- [src/store/useKineticStore.ts]: Central Zustand store for state management.
- [src/lib/]: Core logic for habit calculations, momentum, and sync.
- [src/components/]: UI components including dashboard cards and charts.

## Key Logic
- **Momentum Score**: Managed in `useKineticStore.ts`, involves bonuses for completions and daily decay.
- **Syncing**: Handled via Supabase in `src/lib/sync.ts` and `src/lib/supabase.ts`.
- **Habit Streaks**: Calculated dynamically based on `HabitLog` entries.

## Technical Details
- **Stack**: Next.js 15, React 19, Tailwind CSS 4, Framer Motion, Zustand, Supabase.
- **Persistence**: Zustand `persist` middleware with `localStorage`.
- **Styling**: Monochrome design system with glassmorphic elements.
